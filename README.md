# Enhancing the Magic Formula With Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP) Approach: A Study on S&P 500 Stocks

## Abstract
Although Magic Formula is a popular investment strategy, there has been a notable lack of studies on the performance of Magic Formula on S&P 500 stocks during recent periods. This paper revisits the performance of Magic Formula from January 2011 to April 2024 by using survivorship bias-free financial data to simulate an investment portfolio, with a focus on risk evaluations. According to the analysis, the original Magic Formula achieved a 14.69% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR), which was higher than the S&P 500 Indexâ€™s CAGR of 13.16%. However, it showed higher volatility, larger maximum drawdowns, and a lower Sharpe ratio compared to the index. By incorporating the Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP) approach, the revised Magic Formula produced better results, with a 15.86% CAGR, decreased volatility, and a higher Sharpe ratio, making it the top-performing strategy among the tested strategies.
